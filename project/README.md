# Project Overview

As the amount of information available on the web grows rapidly in recent decade, recommender system becomes an inevitable approach to avoid providing users with contents that are not of their interest across a variety of web domains. Recommender systems with implicit feedback have attracted many studies recently as it is easier to collect implicit feedbacks from massive users such as “like” or “dislike” rather than specific ratings. However, as there is no rating information, it is harder to capture user’s degree of interest over items and requires more advanced strategies. For review-based web platform such as Yelp, social network of users is easily accessible and can serve as an additional source to better capture user preference. For users with little or no feedback, there is a high chance that they will like the item if most of their friends like it. In this work, we explore the possibility of incorporating social network information with implicit feedbacks to enhance performance of existing recommender systems. We use Bayesian Personalized ranking method for implicit feedback as our baseline model which is only based on user-item interactions. We will design our model that uses both user-item interaction and social network and compare it with baseline model to illustrate the effect of incorporating social network with recommender system.
